# KodeCamp - {finsweet solution

This is my solution to the Bootstrap task.
The fist page is a landing page that leads to the Quiz questions.
Enjoy!

I use my phone to code, pardon some little errors especially when its not responsive. This task is done for desktop view for now,and it is not responsive in mobile.

I used my phone to code.

### Built with
- SPCK for mobile is what I use to code.
- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned


I learnt how to use the bootstrap properties.
I learnt how to just make things work, its quite harder though, but then I always love to try.



### Continued development
I hope to improve on this skill, although coding with my phone is a bit difficult.
